# Stack decision (timeboxed)

> Default recommendation (2026): **TypeScript + Next.js (App Router) + Postgres + Prisma/Drizzle + Auth.js + Tailwind/shadcn**.
> Use this unless constraints suggest otherwise. Timebox research; ship.

## Context
- Project:
- Constraints (security, latency, cost, team skills, deploy target):

## Recommendation (pick one)
**Recommended stack (default):**
- Runtime/language: TypeScript (Node 22+)
- Web: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- DB: Postgres (managed)
- ORM: Prisma (or Drizzle)
- Auth: Auth.js (or Clerk)
- UI: Tailwind + component library (e.g., shadcn)
- Validation: Zod
- Testing: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e)
- Lint/format: ESLint + Prettier (or Biome)

## Alternatives (2)
1) Python API + React UI
2) Go API + TS web

## Why this choice (brief)
- Pros:
- Cons:
- Key tradeoffs:

## Research notes (timeboxed)
- Sources consulted (3–5 max):
  - 

## Next steps
- Wire `Makefile` targets (`setup/test/lint/format`)
- Add CI (copy from chosen variant)
- Record decision in `.claude/knowledge-base/tech-stack-decisions.md`
