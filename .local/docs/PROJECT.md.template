# Project

## One‑liner
What are we building?

## Users
Who is this for?

## Success criteria (v1)

## Default 2026 constraints (edit as needed)

- Testing: unit tests for new logic, integration tests for critical paths
- API-first: business logic separated from UI; stable internal API surface
- UI/UX: accessible (WCAG AA), responsive, fast first load
- Maintainability: small diffs, clear naming, minimal dependencies

## Non-goals
What are we explicitly not doing?

## Architecture sketch
High-level components and data flow.

## Dev workflow
- How to run:
- How to test:
