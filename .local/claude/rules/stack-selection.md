# Stack selection rules

When the tech stack is not predetermined:

- Propose **1 recommended stack** and **2 alternatives**.
- Timebox research: **10–15 minutes** or **3–5 sources max**.
- Prefer boring, well-supported defaults unless constraints demand otherwise.
- Write down the decision in:
  - `docs/STACK_DECISION.md` (copy from template if missing)
  - `.claude/knowledge-base/tech-stack-decisions.md`

Output should include:
- Rationale + tradeoffs
- How to run / test / lint / format (commands)
